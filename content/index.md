A shot from Yi Yi that we love -- intimate emotions from paralyzingly far.</div>

## Until Rockridge

Two former lovers — Mark, a painter, and Katherine, a curator — reunite after a gallery event. On impulse, Mark convinces her to ride the train home together, hoping to finally say what he never could. As the city blurs past, they navigate the pull of old chemistry and the pain of old wounds, trapped between the urge to hold on and the need to let go.

- We're targeting a run-time of anywhere between 6 to 12 minutes. We expect dialogue to 50 to 70% of the run-time, and cinematic shots / music will be filling the rest.
- Filming/Post-production will likely take place September 2025 - October 2025

## Plot
The film is split into 5 main scenes.
1. *Platform* - Introduce Mark and Katherine to their improbable trip home together
2. *Again* - Is it really you again?
3. *摸石头过河* - Do you remember what this was like?
    - It means, crossing the river by feeling for the stones. *If* you can feel the stones, then you can boldly take steps in the right direction, and trust that you'll make it across eventually.
4. *Ceasefire* - Let me surrender.
    - We're hoping to catch capture what those ethereal last 2 stops might feel like listening to the songs they used to fall asleep to.
5. *Rockridge* - Give and take, where do we go now?
    - We're really excited to double down on long shots here, and see if we can use distance to bring the characters closer.

## Who we are and why are we making this film?
- We're a group of romantics, trying to have fun!
- We want to figure out what happens in *liminal spaces*
- We are inspired by the emotions from films like *Chunking Express, Before Sunrise, Hotel Chevalier, and Yi YI*.

# What are we looking for?
An actress for *Katherine*:
- mid twenties
- art gallery host
- daring, naive, humble

An actor for *Mark*:
- mid twenties
- painter
- dreamer, yearning for something

Someone with experience with *Audio*:
- knows how to setup-for and execute re-recorded audio
- record in loud environments like the BART

People who are excited to help in any other capacity!

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
On the bridge. Do you remember? The first time.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
The first time?<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
The first time we met. After we had left the party.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
The Daly's party?<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
Yeah.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
I don't remember a bridge.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
You don't?<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
I remember walking, but I don't remember a bridge.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
It had just rained and the creek was full.<br>
I was thinking of that. The lights reflected in the river. The lights out there reminded me of it.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
Maybe you're thinking of someone else.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
I can't be.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
That would be embarrassing.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
<i>(chuckling)</i><br>
It would be.<br>
No I swear it was you. You had on that camel coat. The one you lost in New York.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
I loved that coat.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
It was cold and you had the fluffy hood up.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
And you had on that - that thin nylon navy jacket.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
Yes!<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
And I joked that your lips were matching the color of the coat.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
That's right!<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
We weren't on a bridge though.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
We weren't.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
No. We were on the corner of my street.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
It's so clear.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
I wouldn't trust your memory.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
Why.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
I didn't lose that coat - you did.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
Right...<br>
And you yelled at me on the airplane.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
Did I?<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
In front of everyone.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
Hmmm I did didn't I.<br>
It was a really nice coat.<br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
It was a really nice bridge.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
Just if I could remember.<br>

<i>(they both laugh)</i><br>

<strong>Mark:</strong><br>
It was a long time ago.<br>

<strong>Katherine:</strong><br>
It was...<br>

<i>(They both sigh and catch their breath.)</i><br>
