A shot from Yi Yi that we love -- intimate emotions from paralyzingly far.</div>

## Until Rockridge
Two former lovers reunite by chance on a train ride home and break a long silence between them. As the world rushes past, they revisit the unspoken, caught between holding on and letting go. This is a story of the orbits we navigate with the ones we still love.

## Who we are and why are we making this film?
- We're a group of romantics, trying to have fun!
- We want to figure out what happens in *liminal spaces*
- We are inspired by the emotions from films like *Chunking Express, Hotel Chavelier, Yi YI*.

# What are we looking for?
An actress for *Katherine*:
- mid twenties
- art gallery host
- daring, naive, humble

An actor for *Mark*:
- mid twenties
- painter
- dreamer, yearning for something

Someone with expreience with *Audio*:
- knows how to setup-for and execute re-recorded audio
- record in loud environments like the BART

People who are excited to help in any other capacity!
