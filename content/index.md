## Until Rockridge

Two former lovers — Mark, a painter, and Katherine, a curator — reunite after a gallery event. On impulse, Mark convinces her to ride the train home together, hoping to finally say what he never could. As the city blurs past, they navigate the pull of old chemistry and the pain of old wounds, trapped between the urge to hold on and the need to let go.

- We're targeting a run-time of anywhere between 6 to 12 minutes. We expect dialogue to 50 to 70% of the run-time, and cinematic shots / music will be filling the rest.
- Filming/Post-production will likely take place September 2025 - October 2025

## Plot
The film is split into 5 main scenes.
1. *Platform* - Introduce Mark and Katherine to their improbable trip home together
2. *Again* - Is it really you again?
3. *摸石头过河* - Do you remember what this was like?
    - It means, crossing the river by feeling for the stones. *If* you can feel the stones, then you can boldly take steps in the right direction, and trust that you'll make it across eventually.
4. *Ceasefire* - Let me surrender.
    - We're hoping to catch capture what those ethereal last 2 stops might feel like listening to the songs they used to fall asleep to.
5. *Rockridge* - Give and take, where do we go now?
    - We're really excited to double down on long shots here, and see if we can use distance to bring the characters closer.

## Who we are and why are we making this film?
- We're a group of romantics, trying to have fun!
- We want to figure out what happens in *liminal spaces*
- We are inspired by the emotions from films like *Chunking Express, Before Sunrise, Hotel Chevalier, and Yi YI*.

# What are we looking for?
An actress for *Katherine*:
- mid twenties
- art gallery host
- daring, naive, humble

An actor for *Mark*:
- mid twenties
- painter
- dreamer, yearning for something

Someone with experience with *Audio*:
- knows how to setup-for and execute re-recorded audio
- record in loud environments like the BART

People who are excited to help in any other capacity!
