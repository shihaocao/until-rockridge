I did two terrible things

```

const Header: QuartzComponent = ({ cfg, tree, children, fileData }: QuartzComponentProps) => {
  // console.log("FOO")
  // console.log(tree)
  // console.log(fileData)
  // const title = cfg?.pageTitle;
  // if (title !== "Shihao's Site") {
  // Terrible Terrible Hack to see if we're on the main landing page LOL
  if (fileData.filePath !== "content/index.md") {
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <div className="header-container">
      <div className="spacer"></div> {/* Left Spacer */}
      <div className="customheaderdiv">
        <br />
        <h1>Hello! I'm Shihao</h1>
        <p>Welcome</p>
        <p>Things I am grateful for</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The opportunity to be alive</li>
          <li>The opportunity to grow</li>
          <li>Longboarding</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="spacer"></div> {/* Right Spacer */}
      <div className="spacer"></div> {/* Right Spacer */}

    </div>
  );
};
```

Wrote this garbage to make a custom header. This seems... wrong but whatever lol

Secondly, I can't figure out how to turn off darkmode. So I went to `quartz.layout.ts` and commented out `Darkmode()`
